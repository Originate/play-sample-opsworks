# Resources / Providers

## artifact_deploy

Deploys a collection of build artifacts packaged into a tar ball. Artifacts are extracted from
the package and managed in a deploy directory in the same fashion you've seen in the Opscode
deploy resource or Capistrano's default deploy strategy.

### Deploy Flow, the Manifest, and Procs

The deploy flow is outlined in the Artifact Deploy flow chart below.

![Artifact Deploy](https://raw.github.com/RiotGames/artifact-cookbook/gh-pages/images/ArtifactDeployFlow.png)

For a more detailed flow of what happens when we check with `deploy?`, see the [Manifest Differences Flow chart.](http://riotgames.github.com/artifact-cookbook/images/ManifestDifferencesFlow.png)

The 'happy-path' of this flow is the default path when an artifact has already been deploy - there will be no need to
execute many of the Procs. That being said, there are a few 'choice' paths through the flow where a Proc may affect the
flow.

There are two checks in the artifact deploy flow where a *manifest* check is executed - at the beginning, before the *before_deploy* proc,
and just after the *configure* proc (and after the *migrate* procs). When the latter check returns true, the *restart* proc will execute.

The *manifest* is a YAML file with a mapping of files in the deploy path to their SHA1 checksum. For example:

```
/srv/artifact_test/releases/2.0.68/log4j.xml: 96be5753fbf845e30b643fa04008f2c4fe6956a7
/srv/artifact_test/releases/2.0.68/readme.txt: fcb8d816b062565930f19f9bdb954f5ac43c5039
/srv/artifact_test/releases/2.0.68/my-artifact.jar: 42ad63cc883afad010573d3d8eea4e5a4011e5d4
```

There are numerous Procs placed throughout the flow of the artifact_deploy resource. They are meant to give the user many different
ways to configure the artifact and execute resources during the flow. Some good examples include executing a resource to stop a service
in the *before_deploy* proc, or placing configuration files in the deployed artifact during the *configure* proc.

**Please note** the *before_deploy*, *configure*, and *after_deploy* procs are executed on every Chef run. It is recommended that any *template*
(or configuration changing resource calls) take place within those procs. In particular, the *configure* proc was added for this very purpose. Following
this pattern will ensure that the templates will change, and the *restart* proc will execute (perhaps restarting the service the configured artifact provides
in order to pick up the configuration changes).

Procs can also utilize the internal methods of the provider class, because they are evaluated inside of the instance of the provider class. For example:

```
artifact_deploy "artifact_test" do
  # omitted for brevity
  configure Proc.new {
    # release_path is an attr_reader on the @release_path variable
    template "#{release_path}/conf/config.properties" do
      source "config.properties.erb"
      variables(:config => config)
    end
  }
end
```

## artifact_file

Downloads a file from a provided location and then verifies that the integrity of the file is intact. Artifact files from Nexus
will check with the Nexus Server to verify the SHA1 of the downloaded file. Artifact files from an HTTP or S3 source will either use
the provided SHA256 checksum to verify integrity or skip the check if no checksum is given.

### Actions
Action   | Description                   | Default
-------  |-------------                  |---------
create   | Download the artifact file    | Yes

### Attributes
Attribute              | Description                                                                          |Type     | Default
---------              |-------------                                                                         |-----    |--------
path                   | The path to download the artifact to                                                 | String  | name
location               | The location to the artifact file. Either a nexus identifier, S3 path or URL         | String  |
checksum               | The SHA256 checksum for verifying URL downloads. Not used when location is Nexus     | String  |
owner                  | Owner of the downloaded file                                                         | String  |
group                  | Group of the downloaded file                                                         | String  |
download_retries       | The number of times to attempt to download the file if it fails its integrity check  | Integer | 1

### Downloading files using artifact_file

In its simplest state, the artifact_file resource is a wrapper for the remote_file resource for Nexus and URL locations. The key addition is retry logic and integrity checking
for the downloaded files. Below is a brief description of the logic flow for the resource:

* Download the file using remote_file resource.
* Check the file's integrity
  * Is it from the Nexus?
      * Check the SHA1 of the downloaded file against Nexus Server's SHA1. Returns false if they are not equal.
  * Not from Nexus - Is the checksum attribute defined for the resource?
      * If defined - Check the SHA256 of the downloaded file against the checksum attribute. Returns false if they are not equal.
      * If not defined - log a message and return true.

When the logic returns true, the downloaded file is considered good and the resource will exit. When the logic above returns false, the downloaded file is considered
corrupt and an attempt will be made to download the file again. The number of retries can be controlled with the `download_retries` attribute.


## artifact_package

Downloads a file with artifact_file, then calls the package resource to install it.

### Actions
Action   | Description                               | Default
-------  |-------------                              |---------
install  | Download and install the artifact file    | Yes

### Attributes

group                  | Group of the downloaded file                                                         | String  |

# Documentation

The RDocs for the deploy.rb provider can be found under the [Top Level Namespace](http://riotgames.github.com/artifact-cookbook/doc/top-level-namespace.html) page
for this repository.

## Nexus Usage

By default, deploying an artifact from a Nexus repository requires an [encrypted data bag](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Encrypted+Data+Bags) that contains
the credentials for your Nexus repository.

    knife data bag create artifact _wildcard -c <your chef config> --secret-file=<your secret file>

Your data bag should look like the following:

    {
      "id": "_wildcard",
      "nexus": {
        "username": "nexus_user",
        "password": "nexus_user_password",
        "url": "http://nexus.yourcompany.com:8081/nexus/",
        "repository": "your_repository"
      }
    }

After your encrypted data bag is setup you can use Maven identifiers
as your `artifact_location` attribute. A Maven identifier is shown as a colon-separated string
that includes three elements - groupId:artifactId:extension - ex. "com.my.artifact:my-artifact:tgz".
If many environments share the same configuration, you can provide environment specific configuration in
separate data_bag items:

    knife data bag create artifact production -c <your chef config> --secret-file=<your secret file>

    {
      "id": "production",
      "nexus": {
        "username": "nexus_production_user",
        "password": "nexus_production_user_password",
        "url": "http://nexus.yourcompany.com:8081/nexus/",
        "repository": "your_repository"
      }
    }

    knife data bag create artifact development -c <your chef config> --secret-file=<your secret file>

    {
      "id": "development",
      "nexus": {
        "username": "nexus_dev_user",
        "password": "nexus_dev_user_password",
        "url": "http://nexus-dev.yourcompany.com:8081/nexus/",
        "repository": "your_repository"
      }
    }

To further customize your Nexus usage, you can use the new `nexus_configuration` attribute. To do so, create a new `Chef::Artifact::NexusConfiguration` object, passing it
the customized parameters - url, repository, username (defaults to nil), password (defaults to nil), ssl_verify (defaults to true). Then pass that object to the `artifact_deploy` resource. For example:

    nexus_configuration_object = Chef::Artifact::NexusConfiguration("http://nexus-url", "snapshots", "username", "password")

    artifact_deploy "my-artifact" do
      version             "latest"
      artifact_location   "com.foo:my-artifact:tgz"
      nexus_configuration nexus_configuration_object
      deploy_to           "/opt/my-artifact"
      owner               "artifact"
      group               "artifact"
    end

To access a Nexus repository anonymously, simply omit the username and password from the construction of the `Chef::Artifact::NexusConfiguration` object.

## S3 Usage

S3 can be used as a source of an archive.  The location path must be in the form ```s3://s3-endpoint/bucket-name/path/to/archive.tar.gz```.  You can provide AWS credentials in the data_bag,
or if you are running on EC2 and are using IAM Instance Roles - you may omit the credentials and use the Instance Role. Alternatively, if the credentials are available on the
environment they will be used from there (more information on the Environment variable keys an be found <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsRuby/latest/DeveloperGuide/ruby-dg-roles.html>).

The S3 endpoints are documented here <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region>.

If you want to retrieve an object from an S3 bucket in the US-Standard region - use the following format: ```s3://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/path/to/archive.tar.gz```.

If you want to retrieve and object from a bucket in the US West (Oregon) Region region ```s3://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/path/to/archive.tar.gz``` or EU (Ireland) Region:  ```s3://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/path/to/archive.tar.gz```

This is example IAM policy to get an artifact from S3. Note that this policy will limit permissions to just the files contained under the ```deploys/``` path.
If you wish to keep them in the root of your bucket, just omit the ```deploys/``` portion and put ```<your-s3-bucket>/*```:

    {
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "Stmt1357328135477",
          "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:ListBucket"
          ],
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::<your-s3-bucket>/deploys/*",
            "arn:aws:s3:::<your-s3-bucket>"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

If you wish to provide your AWS credentials in a data_bag, the format is:

    {
      "id": "_wildcard",
      "aws": {
        "access_key_id": "my_access_key",
        "secret_access_key": "my_secret_access_key"
      }
    }

Your data_bag can contain both ```nexus``` and ```aws``` configuration.

      force             node[:force_deploy]
    end

##### Using artifact_file to download a file from a URL

    artifact_file "/tmp/my-artifact.tgz" do
      location "http://www.my-website.com/my-artifact-1.0.0.tgz"
      owner "me"
      group "mes"
      action :create
    end

#### Using artifact_file to download a file from Nexus

    artifact_file "/tmp/my-artifact.tgz" do
      location "com.test:my-artifact:tgz:1.0.0"
      owner "me"
      group "mes"
      action :create
    end

  Configuring your resource in this manner will allow you to ensure it can always change when you need it to. In other words,
  configuring the `force` attribute to a node attribute, will allow you to change some of the more finer grained aspects of the
  resource. For example, when force is true, you can also change the value of owner and group to remap the deployed artifact to
  a new permissions scheme.

##### Using artifact_file to download a file from an S3 bucket

    artifact_file "/tmp/my-artifact.tgz" do
      location "s3://s3.amazonaws.com/my-website-deployments/deploys/my-artifact-1.0.0.tgz"
      owner "me"
      group "mes"
      checksum "fcb188ed37d41ff2cbf1a52d3a11bfde666e036b5c7ada1496dc1d53dd6ed5dd"
      action :create
    end

##### Using artifact_package to install an rpm from a website

    artifact_package "tomcat" do
      location "http://my-website/tomcat-5.0.rpm"
      owner "me"
      group "mes"
      action :install
    end

##### Using artifact_package to install an rpm from Nexus

    artifact_package "tomcat" do
      location "com.rpm:tomcat:rpm:6.0.0"
      owner "me"
      group "mes"
      action :install
    end

# Testing

A sample cookbook is available in `fixtures`. You can package it with mkartifact.sh, and
upload it to Nexus as artifact_cookbook:test:1.2.3:tgz.

Set the artifact_test_location and artifact_test_version environment variables when running
vagrant to change how they'll be provisioned. Default is 1.2.3 from a file URL.

* artifact_test_location=artifact_cookbook:test:1.2.3:tgz artifact_test_version=1.2.3 bundle exec vagrant
